From singing acapella for private events, to singing with different bands for many weddings, to DJing clubs and private events all over the US, Michael comes with 9 years of vast experience in the music industry. Additionally, from becoming self-taught in piano and guitar, Michael also has a BA in Music from Brooklyn College. He has also recently released a single with his father Shlomo Haviv called “Ase Mitzvah”, which was produced and mixed by him and has 13,000 views worldwide. He is also currently working on his father’s new album (which is going to be released in the upcoming months) and will also be collaborating on the album with him as well.
